Nerd Dinner CRUD example -> Introduce commands
===========


* create command classes (POCOs) - create them manually with "add new class..."
* have a look at the command handler and the aggregate
* refactor the controller actions into methods of the corresponding aggregates


New additional domain logic:
-> If a member has submitted his third Nerd Dinner than his status changes to gold member.
